# Cycle-Directions App

This is an ongoing project to create a cycling directions app for London.

It will use data from the TFL open data to map where the cycleways are in London and simplify the directions between places.

I found that using an app for directions when cycling around London means you have to check your phone for every turn which can be dangerous. I then noticed that there are a lot of designated cycleways around London that are safe and well signposted. This app will use directions such as "follow the C2 to shoreditch High Street" in place of a list of turns when it can.

This should simplify the directions, making routes safer to navigate easier to remember.
